# scripts/flux-id-display
This is a Standalone Script for any type of FiveM server.
This code displays your personal server ID above the map. It is possible to change the position of the text. It's not a command or toggle or anything - it will always be intact above your map or wherever else you place it.
You can walk, jog and run while holding your hands up.

# Configuring the script
This script is a Drag & Drop script meaning you don't have to do any further configuration to make it work!
## Instructions:
1. Download the master file
2. Add the script to your resources folder
3. Start the script in your server.cfg

Assuming the resource's name is original, this is what you'd add to your server.cfg file:
```
start flux-id
```
