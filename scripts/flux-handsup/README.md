# scripts/flux-handsup
This is a Standalone Script for any type of FiveM server.
This code lets you put your hands up above your head for roleplay or other measures. The default keybind is ALT, it is however changeable in the client.lua file.
You can walk, jog and run while holding your hands up.

# Configuring the script
This script is a Drag & Drop script meaning you don't have to do any further configuration to make it work!
## Instructions:
1. Download the master file
2. Add the script to your resources folder
3. Start the script in your server.cfg

Assuming the resource's name is original, this is what you'd add to your server.cfg file:
```
start flux-handsup
```
