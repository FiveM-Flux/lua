# scripts/flux-antipistolwhip
This is a Standalone Script for any type of FiveM server.
This code disables the ability to pistol whip players and peds/NPC's.
It disables pressing R and LMB (default buttons - it also affects changed keybinds)

# Configuring the script
This script is a Drag & Drop script meaning you don't have to do any further configuration to make it work!
## Instructions:
1. Download the master file
2. Add the script to your resources folder
3. Start the script in your server.cfg

Assuming the resource's name is original, this is what you'd add to your server.cfg file:
```
start flux-antipistolwhip
```
